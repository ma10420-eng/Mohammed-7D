<h2>  Mohamed Salah, the Egyptian King,
Makes the Kop and all fans sing.
He runs past all with pace and with art,
And scores many goals to warm every heart.
The ball follows him like a friendly pup,
And the crowd goes wild when he gives a thumbs up.
  </h2>

    <h3>  mo salah chant If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me,"
"If he scores another few then I'll be Muslim too!"
"If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me,"
"He's sitting in a mosque, that's where I want to be!"
"His name is Mo Salah, he's runnin' down the line."
"And when he scores another goal, we'll sing it one more time."  </h3>
